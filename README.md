High-toughness shear deformation localization in crystalline intermetallics (cover article in Nature Materials, IF=37.2 )
•	Designed and conducted advanced materials characterization (FIB, SEM, HRTEM) and nano-mechanical tests, capturing definitive evidence of the phase transformation inside 3nm-wide shear deformation bands 
•	Discovered a toughness-enhancing (outstanding strength and ductility) deformation mechanism in Al-Sm material, potentially applicable to next-generation high-toughness armors and helmets
